                <span className="font-semibold">Hi there!</span> My name is
                Bart≈Çomiej Piekarz, and I am the founder of CleanupHub. I am
                full-stack developer from Poland, passionate about technology
                and the psychology. I created CleanupHub to combine my love for
                coding with my desire to make a positive impact on the world.
              </p>
              <p className="max-w-2xl text-lg">
                I believe that small actions can lead to big changes, and I am
                committed to empowering others to take action and create a
                better future for our planet. Together, we can make a
                difference!

              <p className="max-w-2xl text-lg">
                This project was initialy created as a project for hackathon and
                was later developed into a full-fledged platform. I hope that
                CleanupHub will inspire you to get involved in environmental
                initiatives and work towards a more sustainable world.
              </p>

                I should also mention that I wouldn&apos;t thought of creating
                this kind of up without my girlfriend, who is also passionate
                about environmental conservation. She is the one who inspired me
                to take action and create CleanupHub.
